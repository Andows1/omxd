omxd daemon to maintain a playlist and play it via omxplayer
============================================================

The omxd daemon plays your playlist even if you've disconnected from your
Raspberry Pi, to allow the easy implementation of various media centre apps.
Typically, start omxd from the /etc/rc.local stript at boot time.

COMMANDS
--------
omxd listens for commands through the /var/run/omxctl FIFO,
please write one command at a time into it, for example:

echo A /home/foo/bar.mp3 > /var/run/omxctl

Playlist commands: Files shall be absolute paths or URLs playable by omxplayer.

i file	insert to playlist before current item
I file	interrupt playlist, play file on default output, then continue playlist
H file	interrupt playlist, play file on HDMI, then continue playlist
J file	interrupt playlist, play file on Jack, then continue playlist
a file	add to playlist after current item
A file	append to end of playlist
.	replay current item
h	change default output to HDMI
j	change default output to Jack
n	next
N	previous
x	delete current item from playlist, play next
X	delete entire playlist

Others commands control the running omxplayer instance.

f	forward 30s
r	rewind  30s
F	forward 600s
R	rewind  600s
p	play/pause
k	next audio stream
o	next chapter
m	next subtitle stream
s	toggle subtitles

FILES
-----
The files below are created in /var/run/ when omxd is started by root
during boot. But if you start it manually by yourself, all files are created
in the current directory to allow easier testing.

/var/run/omxctl 	FIFO to write commands into
/var/run/omxplay	playlist file, actual item indicated by >
/var/log/omxlog		log file
