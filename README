omxd(1) --  daemon to maintain a playlist and play it via omxplayer
===================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

 omxd
 echo <command> [abs-path] > /var/run/omxctl
 omxd <command> [rel-path]

## DESCRIPTION

The omxd daemon plays your playlist even if you've disconnected from your
Raspberry Pi, to allow the easy implementation of various media centre apps.
Typically, start omxd from the /etc/rc.local stript at boot time.

## COMMANDS

omxd listens for commands through the /var/run/omxctl FIFO,
please write one command at a time into it, for example:

echo A /home/foo/bar.mp3 > /var/run/omxctl

Playlist commands: Files shall be absolute paths or URLs playable by omxplayer.

 i file	insert to playlist before current item
 I file	interrupt playlist, play file on default output, then continue playlist
 H file	interrupt playlist, play file on HDMI, then continue playlist
 J file	interrupt playlist, play file on Jack, then continue playlist
 a file	add to playlist after current item
 A file	append to end of playlist
 .	replay current item
 h	change default output to HDMI
 j	change default output to Jack
 n	next
 N	previous
 x	delete current item from playlist, play next
 X	delete entire playlist

Others commands control the running omxplayer instance.

 r	rewind  30s
 F	forward 600s
 R	rewind  600s
 p	play/pause
 k	next audio stream
 o	next chapter
 m	next subtitle stream
 s	toggle subtitles
 -	volume down

Client commands:

 S	show what's playing now

## CLIENT MODE

You can call omxd with the above commands as arguments, it writes them
into /var/run/omxctl, but translates relative paths into absolute ones
and performs commands recursively if you specify a directory as the file.

## FILES

When you start the omxd daemon as an unprivileged user the files below
will be created in the current directory instead of the locations below,
to allow easier testing.

 /var/run/omxctl 	FIFO to write commands into
 /var/run/omxplay	playlist file, actual item indicated by >
 /var/log/omxlog	log file
 /etc/omxd		defines user to run omxplayer: user=foo
